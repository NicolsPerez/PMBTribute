 <h4><textarea name=? cols="50" rows="16">This is a tribute site to a small but lovely cafe, located in central Orlando, FL. Its motivation is to cater healthy ingredients to people. They specifically serve asian style dishes and creative pastries with the promise of no preservatives, nor additives, less sugar and less calories. Along with theming it all behind the renown Spanish artist Pablo Ruiz Picasso. This cafe seems to have an appreciation for quality, health, and art. They like to occasionally feature events at their establishment where they support small artists or host fan events. I was very fond of this place and felt the need to create a fun website so people can get to know it better. If you want to check out their shop hours, location, or order from them please refer to the link below.</textarea>
